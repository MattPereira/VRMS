# Volunteer Relationship Management System

VRMS is a tool used for the engagement, support, and retention of a network of volunteers.

This is an ambitious project to create a system that will help us measure our human capital development, reduce repetitive tasks and processes for leadership, and improve outcomes for both volunteers and the projects they contribute to.

This README is just a brief overview. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/VRMS/wiki/Introduction) for more information.

## Project Context

We are currently in the initial planning phase after delivering a prototype to the organization's leadership. Our priorities are laying out a feature roadmap for beta and beyond, and recruiting a team of dedicated members to build the product. Time is of the essence, as each team meeting is a new opportunity to garner valuable data which, in return, supports the organization and it's members.
